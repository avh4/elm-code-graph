# elm-global-dependency-graph

I've recently watched a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VLlMl5zK3k) by Fellipe Hoffa about using Google Big Query which allows you to query all the publicly available data of Github. After the talk I was interested to play around with it myself. Since my pet language is Elm right now I wanted to build a Dependency graph of all the elm libraries and projects which are publicly available on Github.
